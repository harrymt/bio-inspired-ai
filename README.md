# Bio-Inspired AI

Selection of scripts for simulating AI experiments inspired by biology. Based on [Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence: Theories, Methods, and Technologies](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1457317).


## Topics

1. [Neural Systems](/neural-systems)
2. [Cellular Automata](/cellular-automata)
3. [Bio-inspired robotics](/bio-inspired-robotics)
4. [Embodiment Morphological Computation](/morphological-computation)
5. [Artificial Evolution](/artificial-evolution)
6. [Evolutionary Robotics](/evolutionary-robotics)


## Roadmap

- Create a docs folder with a static site page
- Implement each topic as a javascript demonstration on this page
