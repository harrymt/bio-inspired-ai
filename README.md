# Bio-Inspired AI

Selection of scripts for simulating AI experiments inspired by biology. Based on [Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence: Theories, Methods, and Technologies](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1457317).


## Topics

- 1. [Neural Systems](/neural-systems)
- 2. [Cellular Automata](/cellular-automata)
- 3. [Bio-inspired robotics](/bio-inspired-robotics)


## Roadmap

- Create a docs folder with a static site page
- Implement each topic as a javascript demonstration on this page
